* Admin page - add stuff like delete(done), name check stuff

* Add anon user passport strategy

* fixx adding when logged in vs adding when not
* Sort skulls by kudos
* Add more types of Kudos, including White Lotus
* candleCount refresh on kudos add

* Kindof Big Thing : Second Pen - 50% opacity white for making fills

* tidy up code and document clearly

* back burner dreams

	1. Scale skulls to size of document.window - responsive equivalent
	3. There is no # 3. 


-------------------------------------

questions & notes to self : 

* best way to handle intentionally shrinking imags?

* difference between logged in and not logged in routes?
aka Eliminate weird redundancies?

* best way to handle relationship between user account and login / pw stuff?

 - look at user schema and experiment with Passport User Model
 - look up passport anon capabilities. 

 ------------------------------------
